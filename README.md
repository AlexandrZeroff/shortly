# Shortly website

[Shortly](https://shortly.zeroff.tech) is a URL shortening API landing page. Created as a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G) challenge solution.

Website created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The main goal of this challenge is to create link-shortener website, which works with link-shortener API and keeps the history of processed links in local storage.

### What features are implemented:

- Fully responsive design
- Shorten any valid URL
- You can see a list of your shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Also copy shortened link to your clipboard in a single click

*Additional: You receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty or entered URL isn`t valid*

### Description

Website is powered by ReactJS with Redux (using [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)), which controls browser local storage. For responsive and sightly UI i used Tailwind CSS framework and good old SASS :)

### Usage

You can try this project on your own server (or localhost):
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
